Amanda Shih

I can do a talk on developing a Khan-academy-like interface for an in-person programming robots class.  I will focus around design decisions to overcome certain challenges:
  * how to design for 10 + students (each controlling their own robot), either using one local server or multiple
  * how to do things modularly, particularly so we can easily switch out boards
  * how to check whether student submitted code has errors before running the code on the robot
  * probably there will other problems I haven't thought of

This project is a work in progress and open sourced.

My plate is already pretty full.

Here are a couple of proposals that we have accepted:

Rachel Smith Stock
Rachel shares how continuous integration has vastly improved productivity in her team’s workflow and explains how simple it is to use git and Jenkins automate your builds ‘in the cloud’. 

So the basic outline of my talk will be: 
- All of the devs in my very small agency are front end devs which forced me in to teaching myself some ‘dev ops’ even though I’d never done it before 
- Adding continuous integration in to our workflow improved productivity & communication - reasons why 
- ‘If you already use task runners like Grunt you are half way there’ - continuous integration simply means moving the build scripts you would run locally to the server and then have those triggered automatically. 
- Show a demo of Jenkins on a Ubuntu box, configuring a task, pushing up to git & triggering a build which then spits out a message to Slack. 
- Final thought - being a Front End developer doesn’t mean you should be scared of dev ops. Don’t let your job title stop you from branching out in to other areas of the stack. "





















√ John Brown  thisisjohnbrown@gmail.com Make Art, Not Apps  "I have been talking about art+tech here in Portland, OR for a long time, and I saw your conference and the inviting nature of submitting and thought I would give a shot to seeing if you’d be interested in having me speak!

I run a creative coding meetup group, I’m a Technical Director at Instrument, and I am a Swiss Army developer (full stack web, software and hardware).

---------

I just wanted to shoot you an email to update you on what I’ve been doing, in regards to talks, in the hopes it will help with the selection process. When I first sent that email, I was brand new to public speaking. In just the couple of months since, I have spoken at three and I am speaking at an Intel conference in two weeks.

About the talk idea I sent you in particular, I gave the first version of if recently at Nodevember. It was a huge hit, and I inspired a lot of people. In just the two weeks since, I have gotten a ton of feedback and updates about the things developers I met have been doing. It is one of the best things I have done with my career, and I want to refine it, update it, and give it to a new audience.

You can see that talk here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kovJHzQNsg0). I was also recently in Berlin at CSSConf EU and gave another really well received talk. That is here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9_jE4V_E7w) so you can get a sense of my speaking style in the different contexts.

Hope this helps the decision making. Have a great week!"  "Developers, as a group, may be losing site of the beauty that code can create. Designers by the bunch are picking up a keyboard and creating amazing pieces, but it's happening the other way very slowly. That's a shame, because the computer lets otherwise unexpressed ideas go unexplored. Javascript developers, in particular, have the ability to embrace the art of programming and the art of art because of the myriad frameworks available. Use Node and JS to make some art, whether it’s in the browser or in the physical realm. Walk away with the confidence and the inspiration to put down the work for a minute and pick up a digital paintbrush.

A bit about me: I run a creative coding meetup group, I’m a Technical Director at Instrument, and I am a Swiss Army developer (full stack web, software and hardware).

Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope to be a part of your amazing conference!

√ Kevin Lamping klamping@gmail.com  Open-Source as a Project Model for Internal Work  Just a side note, I help run the San Antonio JavaScript meetup group, so I'd love to know what y'all are up to over in Houston and if there's any way I can help promote the event for my members (more than just announcing it during meetups). I'd also be interested to talk about how we can work together to foster a community between the to cities. "Even if the work you do for your company is entirely private, there are still many lessons to be learned from the world of open-source software. 

How do they manage to collaborate on a codebase when everyone lives in a different city? How do they encourage contributions when most contributors only have a few minutes to spare? How do they get developers to read the docs?

The problems that OSS projects face mirror the same problems workplaces face and revolve more around human interaction than the code itself. By following the lead of what the open-source world has done, you can ensure a more open, maintainable and friendly project, even if the work you do is closed-source."

√ Pawel Szymczykowski makenai@gmail.com JS in Near Space  "I'd like to submit a talk proposal called 'JS In Near Space' - for lack of a better title for now. I am a small group of hobbyists at work (Zappos.com) have formed a mailing list called space-interest. Our goal is to launch a 600g weather balloon into near space at about 100,000 feet with an electronic payload including sensors and a camera.

We did most of the initial work duing a hackathon, but failed due to a burst balloon. It took us a little while to regroup and reorder backup balloons but we are ready for our next launch attempt next month. The payload contains:

- Raspberry Pi Board running Johnny-Five under node to gather sensor data
- Camera module for the pi
- 6 axis IMU
- Baromoter
- GPS unit
- APRS transmitter
- Electric Altimeter
- Temperature Sensor
- Gunpower powered parachute cord cutter

Since starting this project, 4 of us have earned Technician Class ham radio licenses in order to be able to operate the APRS transmitter and recover our payload. The launch still hasn't happened, so I'm not sure how things will end up. It will either be a success and I'll share the data we gathered with some interesting visualizations we have planned, or it will be a post mortem and I'll attempt to share where we went wrong. :D

  Andrew Dunkman  adunkman@getharvest.com Leveraging Modern Device Features From the Web    "Your website is unresponsive, your cookie size is through the roof. Your competitors have come out with native apps which are flashy and zippy, and they’re eating into your market share. Is it time to drop your website for a native application? Instead of abandoning the web, wouldn’t it be great if you could just spawn a background thread to increase responsiveness, delete some of those cookies and store preferences on the filesystem, and access the accelerometer to get that nifty parallax motion effect — all from the browser? In this talk, you’ll learn to do just that — to spawn threads, save local settings, store your site’s code locally, access a camera and microphone, read accelerometer data, and more! You’ll not only see code samples, but you’ll see working examples designed to get your site off the ground.

√     Demystifying HTTP Headers for a Better Web    "Ever wonder exactly what combination of Cache-Control, Last-Modified, Expires, ETag, Vary, and Pragma headers will keep your content cached by browsers just long enough? And what exactly is a HTTP 304 anyway? In this talk, you’ll learn the history behind the available HTTP caching headers, what their values mean, and how browsers and proxies react. You’ll learn the best practices on client cache invalidation, the benefits of sending a Not Modified response, and briefly talk about the changes in HTTP 2.0 (SPDY) around caching — and then you’ll put your new-found header skills to the test!

√ Felix Palmer  felixpalmer@gmail.com   "I'd like to propose a talk about a project of mine, terra.js. terra.js is a ""Semantic Terrain Rendering Engine"", written in JavaScript and WebGL.

I did a talk about terra.js this year at future.js, you can find the video here: http://www.futurejs.org/agenda/terra-js-a-semantic-terrain-engine

While the project is not currently under active development :( I did work on it solid for 4 months, I do have plenty to talk about surrounding the challenges involved, including:

- Obtaining and processing the terrain, satellite and land cover data for the Earth
- Building a tile based loading system for streaming this data from the server to the client
- Writing a WebGL/JavaScript rendering engine to display this data in the browser
- Developing debugging and other tools to aid in the development of the WebGL portion of the project - it's a bit of a desert out there!

While developing the engine, I often pulled out some interesting problem I was facing, and used this as a basis for a blog post/demo, which can be found here: www.pheelicks.com

Finally, I really like the ethos/idea around SpaceCity.JS, and I hope it all works out for a great conference!" "
I just realized your CFP was about to close, and would like to update my talk proposal. I trust you'll find it more interesting than my ""vapourware"" proposal earlier this year :)

Back then I mentioned a 3D globe project built in WebGL that I was working on. Since then, this has morphed into a 3D mountain simulation allowing users to explore their favorite ski resorts in their browser and even see what it is like to ski down the pistes. I'm very pleased with the output, for this type of terrain I think it beats everything else out there, including products like Google Earth. I attach a few pictures for your reference.

I launched the public beta last week, which you can find here: www.piste.io (note, you will need a WebGL enabled browser).

I would love to come and talk about the making of piste.io at spacecityjs, not only because I really like the theme of the conference, but because I think the building of piste.io is a really good fit. The talk would cover:

- The process of going from initial idea to finished product, what started as a train tracker became a snowy mountain.
- Building my own tools to aid development, e.g. a GLSL validator or a WebGL shader plugin
- Leveraging open source and blogging to guide development and to reach experts.
- Drawing inspiration from demo-scene hackers, e.g. the sorts of things seen on www.shadertoy.com
- Mixing of mathematics, programming and art to create the final result.
- Overall architecture, using Require.js, THREE.js & React.js to create a modern WebGL web-app.
- Processing large elevation datasets and working with OpenStreetMap data. Give me a latitude & longitude and I'll build you a mountain with pistes in 10 seconds."
√ Kyle Tyacke ktyacke@digium.com  Communicate All the Things! "My name is Kyle Tyacke and I'd love to come down to Space City and talk about WebRTC and how it is changing the game by allowing Javascript Devs (and web developers in general) to implement real-time communication into their apps, without plugins, using plain old Javascript! 

There are a couple ways I could structure my talk depending on what you think would best suit the audience. My general idea would be to cover a high level overview of what WebRTC is and how it works from an architecture standpoint (intro to WebRTC), then discuss using the Respoke Javascript library (https://github.com/respoke/respoke) to more quickly implement the features of WebRTC (real-time audio and video, data, and messaging) without the need to worry about setting up an entire backend (ICE, STUN, and TURN servers). I have been working on a first-draft of this talk, and have attached a PDF copy of it to this email for your review. The working title is ""Communicate All the Things!"".

Another option would be to more narrowly focus the talk around a specific area of WebRTC, such as the data channel. There are some really interesting things being developed using the WebRTC data channel and Javascript (PeerCDN, web-based bit-torrent clients, P2P file sharing applications such as Sharefest, and even gaming). If something like this would be more suitable to your audience, then I would be happy to work on something more specific.

√ Eric Clemmons eric@smarterspam.com    "No idea if this proposal is still welcome, but you guys know me & that I spend too much time working on new tech (for work usually) than blogging or writing proposals.  However, I'm really excited about developments I've had in the last two weeks regarding React, as it is a tough nut to crack architectural!
---
For backstory, we have a large Symfony2 (MVC) lead-gen platform with lots of validation & 3 years'  worth of business logic baked into it.  Like all things legacy, performance has been steadily declining, as has flexibility.

So that we can seamlessly render the same experience on the server (no breaking changes for existing users) and ship a library of ""components"" to 3rd-party developers to craft their own (without duplication of validation/business logic), we're utilizing React to build the ""holy grail"" of isometric web apps as DRY & performant as possible.  (Because shipping a hulking framework to a mobile phone to render an app is just rude :D)

We're set to launch our new stack in January, so there will be some pretty before/after graphs for comparison.

Otherwise, maybe I can convince JB to have me show this to the cool kids @ #houstonjs :)

I'm still set for volunteering though!  I get back into town tomorrow.  (I hope Star Pizza's get-together went well)" "Facebook's React has been making waves when it comes to building performant user interfaces across all devices.  Yet, since it only handles the ""V"" in ""MVC"", there are many questions around how to integrate React with the rest of an application.

In this talk, you will learn how a team has successfully replaced a traditional MVC architecture with React (and neighboring libraries) and what ways you can leverage React to improve performance & maintainability."
√ Whitney Williams  wweliz@gmail.com  6 Design Skills That Will Make You a Better Developer   "The belief that design and development have competing interests can stand in the way of successful collaboration. In reality, the principles of good design often mirror those of good development. In this talk, we'll take a look at six design skills that translate well into development:



CREATIVITY -- Creativity is simply the ability to generate and recognize ideas, alternatives, and possibilities to solve problems. While designers and developers solve different types of problems, they both rely on creativity to reframe their thinking and arrive at a viable solution.
INTUITION -- Experienced designers can identify when something just doesn't "feel right." Similarly, experienced developers possess a sense of what programmatic approach will work best. Being able to harness your intuition can increase efficiency dramatically.
EMPATHY -- On of the most important skills designers possess is empathy--the ability to identify and relate to the feelings, thoughts, and attitudes others. In fact, entire professions and companies have been founded on the principles of user-centered design. A programmer who is skilled at anticipating and responding to customer needs is better prepared to capitalize on the possibilities offered by new technologies.
COMMUNICATION -- Design is not purely aesthetics, just as development is not simply lines of code. Designers must consider how functionality affects form, and developers must be creative in building out functionality. Ultimately, designers and developers must work with one another to create a unified entity: the product. The ability to effectively communicate among all members of the team is at the very heart of both design and development.
PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE -- Designers know that innovative ideas don't usually come at the flip of a switch. Instead, the most effective solutions are often the product of hours of thinking, sketching and reworking. Similarly, the best solutions in development are almost always the result of refactoring, of taking a function or snippet of code and engineering it to be faster, simpler, more modular, or independent. A willingness to try and fail is an irreplaceable part of both the design and development processes.
A SENSE OF STRUCTURE AND BALANCE -- Good design demonstrates an innate sense of harmony and balance. Important elements are given more "visual weight" while the use of a grid or other structure encourages the eye to follow a given path across the page. Well written code also exhibits a sense of structure that goes far beyond basic syntax. Semantically written code describes content rather than how that content should look, and can aid in accessibility, speed, as well as the code's readability.

WRITING RELEVANT TO MY TALK:
My blog post "Finding Your Thing" details what led me to transition into a career in tech. In the post "272 Days", I wrote about how hard it was to learn how to code.
