<p>Hi Coders!</p>
<p>We had a small, but fun Girls Coding Club on Labor Day weekend!  We :</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>LOLed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language" target="_blank">esoteric languages</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE" target="_blank">LOLCODE</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC/wiki/ArnoldC" target="_blank">ArnoldC</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learned about git and made some new github accounts and repos!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Researched <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1405739/mvvm-tutorial-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank">MVVM in .NET Framework</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enjoyed a first-time attendee's account of her <strong>experience at the MakerSquare</strong> immersive program in Austin</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Checked out what <a href="http://a.singlediv.com/" target="_blank">a single div and some css magic could do</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Last week, some of us attended a fun and inspiring <a href="http://www.meetup.com/houston-js/events/198371042/" target="_blank">Houston JS talk about coding a multiplayer Tetris in ClojureScript</a>!  I found <a href="http://shaunlebron.com/t3tr0s-slides/" target="_blank">the slides for the talk</a> fascinating to follow, and I learned a couple of things even though I don't (and still don't) know much about ClojureScript.
</p>
<h3>Some upcoming ways to learn include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>

<h3>Some food for thought...</h3>
<p>A friend shared with me interesting articles on tech privilege -- <a href="https://medium.com/tales-from-the-front/on-technical-entitlement-cc9ed433ec3c" target="_blank">one by Tess Rinearson</a> and <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.htm" target="_blank">one by Philip Guo</a>.  I've been contemplating tech privilege and <a href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/impostor-syndrome-is-not-just-a-confidence-problem-dea670e59f6e" target="_blank">the impostor syndrome</a> lately, and I think it would be neat for us to have a round-table discussion about our own experiences with and views on these issues soon.</p>
<p>
  Code on!
