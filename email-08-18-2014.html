<p>Hi Coders!</p>
<p>Thank you for a phenomenal Girls Coding Club this past Saturday!  Some of us learned about Python and R for data analysis, and Javascript for web development.  A couple of us worked with PHP and Wordpress. We also discussed web development versus design, Ruby on Rails, and coding for games.</p>
<p>Some of the free resources we are learning from include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html" target="_blank">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>
<p>A great book for learning Python for beginners with no experience in programming</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript</a>
<p>Helpful with the why behind some of what you are told to do on Codeacademy</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/hciucsd" target="_blank">Human Computer Interaction Class</a> on Coursera
<p>Insight on designing human-centered interfaces on computers</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://classes.codeparkhouston.com/" target="_blank">Minecraft Coding Class</a>
<p>Happened in July, will happen again in December</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 2em;">While there isn't a Girls Coding Club <strong>this coming Saturday, PyLadies is hosting a free <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-HTX/events/200054922/" target="_blank">Python basics workshop</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Based on the awesomeness and informativeness of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-HTX/events/197719232/" target="_blank">the last PyLadies Meetup</a>, this one is bound to be fantastic as well.</p>
<p>Word on the street is that there is a <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a> chapter <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Houston/" target="_blank">starting in Houston</a>.  I am very excited that there are more and more ways to learn to code in Houston.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Nandita, one of our members, is <strong>graduating from The Iron Yard's first class in Houston</strong> this month ☺ !  We can join her and other students on their graduation day to check out <a href="https://ti.to/tiyhouston/demo-day" target="_blank">demos of their work on August 27th</a>!  The Iron Yard even wrote a whole <a href="http://houston.theironyard.com/post/94527703869/the-iron-yard-houston-women-in-tech" target="_blank">blogpost highlighting their women in tech</a>!</p>
<p>Here's an official invitation from campus director Rich Winley to the demo day at START Houston:</p>
<blockquote style="border: 1px dotted #333; padding: 2em;">
<p>Back in June, The Iron Yard started teaching people how to code out of START. We’re now 10 weeks into the program and the students are getting ready to graduate. Come out on<strong> August 27th</strong> to help them celebrate on their graduation day. Beer and snacks on The Iron Yard. You can register at <a href="https://ti.to/tiyhouston/demo-day" target="_blank">https://ti.to/tiyhouston/demo-day</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to switch careers, the next class starts <strong>September 22nd</strong> and applications are <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/houston/" target="_blank">now open here</a>.  We offer scholarships to women as part of our efforts to diversify the web development work force!</p>
<p>You can read all about how graduating students Amy, Nandita, and Adrianne chose to become students at The Iron Yard <a href="http://houston.theironyard.com/post/94527703869/the-iron-yard-houston-women-in-tech" target="_blank">in this blogpost</a> highlighting the women in tech here.</p>
