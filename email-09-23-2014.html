<p>Hi Coders!</p>
<p>Last week, we learned more about git, the most widely used version control today.  We referred to the phenomenal <a href="http://git-scm.com/book" target="_blank">Pro Git Book online</a> a lot.</p>
<p>I remember when I first began programming, I didn't understand the full power of version control.  Now, I know that when I really mess something up, or want to experiment with another way of solving a problem, I can switch back and forth between different versions that git keeps track of for me.  It is also very important for working with other people on the same code as it helps us track our own versions locally and stay up to date with one central version. The Pro Git Book has a really great introduction to what git and version control are <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>On October 25th</strong>, we will not be having Girls Coding Club.  Instead, I'm helping organize and invite you to join Rails Girls Houston for a <a href="http://railsgirls.com/houston" target="_blank"><strong>free</strong> one-day workshop</a> about building a web-application using Rails!  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PYeKLABxAKd-DxXdQYgOMD4-rnn0N9wa-iX1aFJSCLc/viewform" target="_blank">Register here</a>. A few Girls Coding Club members have attended previously and can tell you more about how you might benefit, or you can always ask me =).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I met someone who is taking this <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">CS50 course</a> together with their girls coding group and I think it's a neat idea! Let's talk this weekend about maybe taking it or another course together in the Spring.</p>
<p>See you soon, hopefully this weekend at Girls Coding Club!</p>
