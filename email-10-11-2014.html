<p>Hi Coders!</p>
<p>Thank you for a fantastic Girls Coding Club last time! We learned and shared a lot, from demoing online coding games to working with Python.</p>
<p>
  Here are some of the <strong>resources we shared</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.codingame.com/">Codin' Game</a></p>
    <p>
      This site has contests and games for practicing in many different languages! We also checked out a couple other coding games and puzzles sites like <a href="http://codecombat.com/">Code Combat</a> and <a href="http://exercism.io/">Exercism</a>.

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython">Interactive Python Course</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn">Programming for Everybody (Python)</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Coursera classes about Python recommended by some of us who are currently in or have completed the class!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, both used at our work and in our projects!</p>
    <p>These are very powerful front-end Javascript library/framework.<br/><a href="http://egghead.io">Egghead.io</a> is a particularly great place to start learning how to build with Angular JS.

<p>
  Some <strong>ways to learn coding this week in Houston...</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Visualization-Meetup/events/204736372/">Intro to RStudio &amp; ggplot2</a>, <i>Monday evening</i></p>
    <p>
      Quite a few of us are interested in R! This will be a great talk for anyone curious about harnessing the power of R for visualizing data, and learning some theory behind the grammar of graphics.  Bring your laptop to try some coding at the end of the talk =).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/houston-js/events/111378972/">Testing your Javascript using the Jasmine framework</a>, <i>Tuesday evening</i></p>
    <p>
      This should be good exposure to what Test Driven Development (TDD) can look like.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wednesday, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Programmers-crew/events/197261922/">Introduction to Node.js</a>, <i>Wednesday evening</i></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  See you soon!
